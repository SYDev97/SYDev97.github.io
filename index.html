        <!-- 2. My Interest in IT -->
        <div class="interest-in-it">
            
            <!-- Interest in IT & any IT experience -->
            <p>My interest in IT started back in highscool when my interest was mainly in game design. In more 
                recent years however, I have begun finding myself more and more interested the cryptocurrency 
                and blockain areas of the tech world.</p>
            <p>During my time studying a Bachelor of Interact Media & Design at Bond University, I was given 
                some experience across a small number of fields in the information technology world. These
                main areas being Game design and Website design and development. Along side my study, I spent 
                my spare time learning to code in an array of languages including Java, Python & learning a 
                number of web based frameworks centering around the creation of basic SAAS web platforms.</p>

            <!-- Why did I choose RMIT -->
            <p>My current sutdy at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology was sparked by a newly forming 
                passion in software development & cyber secutiry. I chose to begin studying a Bachelor of 
                Information Technology at RMIT to not only get the degree but to also use it as a pathway 
                to get into a Masters in Cyber Forensics.</p>

            <!-- What do I hope to learn -->
            <p>During my time studying at RMIT, I am hoping to learn more about Aritifical Intelligence, 
                cyber security, software development & website design and development. I am also hoping 
                that RMIT will be able to help me learn the best practices & teach me more about the 
                best tools to use to be successful within the technological world. </p>

            <p>The results from the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">16Personalities</a> 
                test indicate that I am an INTP-T, or Turbulent Logician. As part of these results, the test indicated 
                that I am introverted, intuitive, a thinker and turbulent.</p>
            <p>To me, these results reafirm what I have always believed about myself and my personality. The results 
                show me that I am a person who enjoys working quietly by myself, as well as somebody who enoys exploring 
                new ideas and projects constantly. To me, the issue with this in terms for groups and working 
                collaboratively is that I am usually shy and sometimes lazy which means that I always put a lot more 
                pressure on myself to perform.</p>

            <p>What do these results mean to me?
                how they influence my behaviour in a team?
                how should I take this into account when forming a team? </p>

            <p>Introverted: Introverted individuals prefer solitary activities and get exhausted by social interaction. 
                They tend to be quite sensitive to external stimulation (e.g. sound, sight or smell) in general</p>
            <p>Intuitive: Intuitive individuals are very imaginative, open-minded and curious. They prefer novelty over 
                stability and focus on hidden meanings and future possibilities.</p>
            <p>Thinker: Thinking individuals focus on objectivity and rationality, prioritizing logic over emotions. They 
                tend to hide their feelings and see efficiency as more important than cooperation</p>
            <p> Turbulent: self-concious and sesnative to stress - more likely to experience a wide range of emotions 
                and be success-driven, perctionistic and eager to improve.</p> -->

            <!-- Learning Test : https://personalitymax.com -->
            <p>As part of the learning test that I took from <a href="https://personalitymax.com">personalitymax.com</a>, 
                it indicated that I more of a Kinesthetic learner. </p>
            <p>To me, being a kinesthetic learner is not a surprise. often in the past when I have been trying to teah 
                myself new skill and concepts related to game deisng and programming, I have found that I am someone 
                who dives into actually creating a project through a more trial and error approad and am someone who 
                learns "on the fly" by creating such projects. To me, this often plays an issue into groups as it 
                normally means I am having to re-lern and re-do parts of work over and over again to get it right 
                as I have been trying to teach myself the skills.</p>

            <!-- Psychometric personatlity test. -->
            <p>As part of a psychometric personality test that I took through <a href="http://www.psychometricinstitute.com.au">
                psychometricinstitute.com.au</a> as part of creating this profile, I got a small insite into two of roughly 
                30 scales that some empoyers may look at. The test showed me that I was confident (8/10) and more of an 
                achievment driven (7/10) person.</p>
            <p>Based on my results from this test, it has shown me that I show a great deal of self-confidence in the knowledge 
                that I have and my ability to use this knowledge to solve challenges that I may face. As part of this self 
                confidence, it also indicated that i posses a good ability to manage and out perform within a workplace. 
                The second part of this result showed me that I am more achievement driven. To me, this means that I am 
                someone who can sometimes focus more on simply "getting the job done" rather than focus on doing the 
                best possible I possible can. This achievement driven side, I have found can sometimes play into the 
                more procrastination side when I have work to do.</p>

            <p>Confident in own ability to succeed (8/10):
                This is the extent to which I am confident of my ability to complete and achieve challenging tasks in the 
                workplace.  It assists employers about my self-confidence in my ability to manage and outperform in a role 
                within the workplace. Self-confidence is the most important indicator for success in the workplace.

                Result implies that I believe I have intelligence, ability and drive required to be successful. Confident

                My result indicated that I likely have inner drive and ambition to achieve a successful outcome. However, 
                I am more interested in "getting the job done" rather than achieving excellence in what I do - does not 
                mean I will not invest time and energy, it only means my priority is "getting the job done"</p> -->

        <!-- 5. Project Idea : Property Management Platform-->
        <div class="project-idea">

            <h3>Proposed Project: Rental Property Managemet Platform</h3>

            <!-- Overview : 73 words -->
            <p>The proposed project will be a rental property management platform & company. The idea 
                behind the company & platform would be to give home owners to tools & marketplace to 
                rent out their properties over a longer period of time. The project would not only 
                designed as a website but would also be designed to assist property owners throughout 
                the entire process and even give the user access to dedicated teams of professionals 
                to assist them.</p>

            <!-- Motivation : 107 words -->
            <p>In 2016, the Austrlian census shows that the percentage of Austrlians renting had 
                increased to 30.9% (1) of the population and home owners make up around 60% 
                (2) of the market.</p> 
            <p>Developing such a platform would enable home owners who have little to no experience 
                renting out their properties to gain access to a second stream of income by using 
                such a platform. Not only this, but having a such a platform widely available to 
                the general public, it would allow these home owners to rent out their properties 
                and spare rooms without having to pay up to 15% of their weekly rent (3) on 
                management costs.</p>

            <!-- Description : 406 words -->
            <p>The property management platform would be deisgned in a way that would allow every day home 
                owners who have no experience renting or manageing a property to do so.The platform would be 
                designed to allow property owners to rent out their homes, apartment or spare rooms over 
                longer periods of times, rather than by a single nightly rate like other similar platform. 
                The platform itself as well as the company behind the platform would contain a number of 
                different sections and features to make this easier.</p>
            <p> As part of this platform, it would be designed to contain multiple section, a public property 
                lising, a "renters" dashboard and a "managers" dashboard. With each section playing a role in 
                how the entire platform operates different. </p>
            <p>The first section, the public property listing, would be a place where any user (account or not) 
                could browse through the properties available for rent on the platform. It would also indicate 
                if the property was currently rented and when the property would become vacant again. As part 
                of a safety and security measure, the platform would automatically hide the address of the 
                prperty from the public listing when the property is being rented out.</p>
            <p>The second section, would be the renters dashboard. As part of the renters dahsboard, they would 
                be given access to tools that would allow them to easily contact the landord, manage a current 
                rental, aply for another rental & even manage payments for their current rental. The dashboard 
                for the renter would be designed in a way that allows them easy control and access to 
                information about the property and the landlord as well as information and the remaining 
                duration of their lease. </p>
            <p>The final section of the platform would be the mamangers dashboard. As part of the manager dashbaord, 
                the user would be given access to tools that would allow them to book inspections of their property 
                to ensure the tennent is keeping it clean and tidy, manage applications for new renters, manage the 
                current tenent, get in contact with current and future tennents of the propery and more. The manage 
                dashboard would also allow the user to manageme multiple properties as well as manage the information 
                that is on the webasite about their properties. This information would include images of the property, 
                description, weekly or monthly rent as well as giving the user an option to mark their property as ready 
                to be rented out or not. </p>

            <!-- Tools, Technolofy & Skills Required : 128 Words -->
            <p>Ideally this platform would be designed and developed using a Software as a Service model, meaning 
                that the website would designed and developed as a web based. To have this completed successfully, 
                the development team would require a basic knowledge of the MERN technolofy stack or some equivilent.</p>
            <p>The MERN technology stack is a JavaScript stack centered around using MongoDB, the ExpressJS framework, 
                React JS and Node.js as its core libraries. To ensure this style of software can run smoothly, the 
                platfrom would have to hosted on a dedicated sevrer, a Virtual Private Server or some equivilent of 
                a cloud hosting that supports NodeJS applications.</p>
            <p>All other libraries and frameworks that would be required for such a platform, including; session 
                management, cookies, payment processing are already open source. </p>

            <!-- Outcome : 65 words -->
            <p>If this project were to be successfull, it would not only disrupt the rental market in Australia, 
                it could also be expanded upon to become an interanational platform and help disrupt the 
                property rental market in other countries. Not only this, but if this platform were successful 
                it would give property owners access to a passive income from their properties or spare rooms at home.</p>
