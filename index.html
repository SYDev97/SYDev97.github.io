            <!-- Interest in IT & any IT experience -->
            <p>My interest in IT started back in highscool when my interest was mainly in game design. In more 
                recent years however, I have begun finding myself more and more interested the cryptocurrency 
                and blockain areas of the tech world.</p>
            <p>During my time studying a Bachelor of Interact Media & Design at Bond University, I was given 
                some experience across a small number of fields in the information technology world. These
                main areas being Game design and Website design and development. Along side my study, I spent 
                my spare time learning to code in an array of languages including Java, Python & learning a 
                number of web based frameworks centering around the creation of basic SAAS web platforms.</p>

            <!-- Why did I choose RMIT -->
            <p>My current sutdy at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology was sparked by a newly forming 
                passion in software development & cyber secutiry. I chose to begin studying a Bachelor of 
                Information Technology at RMIT to not only get the degree but to also use it as a pathway 
                to get into a Masters in Cyber Forensics.</p>

            <!-- What do I hope to learn -->
            <p>During my time studying at RMIT, I am hoping to learn more about Aritifical Intelligence, 
                cyber security, software development & website design and development. I am also hoping 
                that RMIT will be able to help me learn the best practices & teach me more about the 
                best tools to use to be successful within the technological world. </p>

        <!-- 5. Project Idea : Property Management Platform-->
        <div class="project-idea">

            <h3>Proposed Project: Rental Property Managemet Platform</h3>

            <!-- Overview : 73 words -->
            <p>The proposed project will be a rental property management platform & company. The idea 
                behind the company & platform would be to give home owners to tools & marketplace to 
                rent out their properties over a longer period of time. The project would not only 
                designed as a website but would also be designed to assist property owners throughout 
                the entire process and even give the user access to dedicated teams of professionals 
                to assist them.</p>

            <!-- Motivation : 61 words -->
            <p>In 2016, the Austrlian census shows that the percentage of Austrlians renting had 
                increased to 30.9% (1) of the population. </p> 
            <p>I believe that this would be an interesting project as it would help people wanting to 
                get into the rental market do so without having to pay the higher commission prices 
                that many realestate agents and property manager charge in Australia.</p>

            <!-- Description -->
            <p></p>

            <!-- Tools & Techniques -->
            <p></p>

            <!-- Skills Required -->
            <p></p>

            <!-- Outcome : 65 words -->
            <p>If this project were to be successfull, it would not only disrupt the rental market in Australia, 
                it could also be expanded upon to become an interanational platform and help disrupt the 
                property rental market in other countries. Not only this, but if this platform were successful 
                it would give property owners access to a passive income from their properties or spare rooms at home.</p>
