                    <!-- Background Information -->
                    <p>	My name is Samuel Young. I am a junior game and website developer located in Brisbane, Australia. Between 2016 and 
                        mid 2020 I have been studying a Bachelor of Interactive Media & Design at Bond University where I was taught many 
                        skills including game design, website design & development, audio design & video editing. </p>

                    <p>In 2014 & 2015 I competed for Australia at two international swimming competitions where

                <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
                <hr>
                
                <!-- Interest in IT & any IT experience -->
                <p>My interest in IT started back in high school when my interest was mainly in game design. In more recent years however, 
                    I have begun finding myself more and more interested the cryptocurrency and blockchain areas of the tech world.</p>
                <p>During my time studying a Bachelor of Interact Media & Design at Bond University, I was given some experience across a 
                    small number of fields in the information technology world. These main areas being Game design and Website design and 
                    development. Alongside my study, I spent my spare time learning to code in an array of languages including Java, Python 
                    & learning several web-based frameworks centring around the creation of basic SAAS web platforms.</p>

                <!-- Why did I choose RMIT -->
                <p>My current study at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology was sparked by a newly forming passion in software 
                    development & cyber security. I chose to begin studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT to not only 
                    get the degree but to also use it as a pathway to get into a master’s in cyber Forensics.</p>

                <!-- What do I hope to learn -->
                <p>During my time studying at RMIT, I am hoping to learn more about Artificial Intelligence, cyber security, software 
                    development & website design and development. I am also hoping that RMIT will be able to help me learn the best 
                    practices & teach me more about the best tools to use to be successful within the technological world. </p>

                    <p>The Cyber Analyst job posted by the Australian Defence force is a job based around identifying, analysing, defending 
                        against and implementing strategies to help mitigate the future possibility of cybercrimes. This job listing is 
                        appealing to me as it is one of the fundamental parts of the cyber security defence jobs that works across several 
                        different government and national fields. Further, this job also indicates that it will not just be a job in one 
                        place but will also allow the candidates to work in the field on remote tasks with various military tactical teams.</p>
    
                    <!-- Skill Required -->
                    <p>The required skills for this job consist of applicants being between 17 and 52, having completed year 10 with a pass 
                        in maths and English. In addition to the basic education requirement, there is a preference for applicants to have 
                        some experience working in ICT as well as having completed appropriate certification.</p>
    
                    <!-- Skill Current -->
                    <p>Based on the minimum requirements for this job, I would be able to directly apply. However, if I wanted to increase 
                        my chances of getting into such a position, my current enrolment with RMIT & hopeful future enrolment in a master’s 
                        in cyber security will be sufficient to help me meet the preferred requirements.</p>

                    <h3>16Personalities</h3>
                    <p>The results from the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">16Personalities</a> 
                        test indicate that I am an INTP-T, or Turbulent Logician. As part of these results, the test 
                        indicated that I am introverted, intuitive, a thinker and turbulent.</p>
                    <p>To me, these results reaffirm what I have always believed about myself and my personality. The 
                        results show me that I am a person who enjoys working quietly by myself, as well as somebody 
                        who enjoys exploring new ideas and projects constantly. To me, the issue with this in terms for 
                        groups and working collaboratively is that I am usually shy and sometimes lazy which means that 
                        I always put a lot more pressure on myself to perform.</p>

                    <h3>Learning Test</h3>
                    <p>As part of the learning test that I took from <a href="https://personalitymax.com">personalitymax.com</a>, 
                        it indicated that I more of a Kinesthetic learner. </p>
                    <p>To me, being a kinesthetic learner is not a surprise. often in the past when I have been trying to 
                        teach myself new skill and concepts related to game design and programming, I have found that I 
                        am someone who dives into actually creating a project through a more trial and error approach 
                        and am someone who learns "on the fly" by creating such projects. To me, this often plays an issue 
                        into groups as it normally means I am having to re-learn and re-do parts of work over and over again 
                        to get it right as I have been trying to teach myself the skills.</p>

                    <h3>Psychometric Personality Test</h3>
                    <p>As part of a psychometric personality test that I took through <a href="http://www.psychometricinstitute.com.au">
                        psychometricinstitute.com.au</a> as part of creating this profile, I got a small insight into two of roughly 
                        30 scales that some employers may look at. The test showed me that I was confident (8/10) and more of an 
                        achievement driven (7/10) person.</p>
                    <p>Based on my results from this test, it has shown me that I show a great deal of self-confidence in the 
                        knowledge that I have and my ability to use this knowledge to solve challenges that I may face. As
                         part of this self-confidence, it also indicated that I possess a good ability to manage and outperform 
                         within a workplace. The second part of this result showed me that I am more achievement driven. To me, 
                         this means that I am someone who can sometimes focus more on simply "getting the job done" rather than 
                         focus on doing the best possible I possibly can. This achievement driven side, I have found can sometimes 
                         play into the more procrastination side when I have work to do.</p>

                    <h3>Brief Overview</h3>
                    <p>The proposed project will be a rental property management platform & company. The idea behind the company & platform would be 
                        to give homeowners to tools &  marketplace to rent out their properties over a longer period. The project would not only be 
                        designed as a website but would also be designed to assist property owners throughout the entire process and even give the 
                        user access to dedicated teams of professionals to assist them.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Motivation : 107 words -->
                <div>
                    <h3>How would this benefit people?</h3>
                    <p>In 2016, the Australian census shows that the percentage of Australians renting had increased to 30.9% (1) of the population 
                        and homeowners make up around 60% (2) of the market.</p> 
                    <p>Developing such a platform would enable homeowners who have little to no experience renting out their properties to gain
                         access to a second stream of income by using such a platform. Not only this, but having a such a platform widely available 
                         to the general public, it would allow these home owners to rent out their properties and spare rooms without having to pay 
                         up to 15% of their weekly rent (3) on management costs.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Description : 406 words -->
                <div>
                    <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
                    <p>The property management platform would be designed in a way that would allow everyday homeowners who have no experience 
                        renting or managing a property to do so. The platform would be designed to allow property owners to rent out their homes,
                         apartment or spare rooms over longer periods of times, rather than by a single nightly rate like other similar platform. 
                         The platform itself as well as the company behind the platform would contain several different sections and features to 
                         make this easier.</p>
                    <p>As part of this platform, it would be designed to contain multiple section, a public property listing, a "renters" dashboard 
                        and a "managers" dashboard. With each section playing a role in how the entire platform operates different.</p>
                    <p>The first section, the public property listing, would be a place where any user (account or not) could browse through the 
                        properties available for rent on the platform. It would also indicate if the property was currently rented and when the 
                        property would become vacant again. As part of a safety and security measure, the platform would automatically hide the 
                        address of the property from the public listing when the property is being rented out.</p>
                    <p>The second section, would be the renters dashboard. As part of the renters dashboard, they would be given access to tools 
                        that would allow them to easily contact the landlord, manage a current rental, apply for another rental & even manage 
                        payments for their current rental. The dashboard for the renter would be designed in a way that allows them easy control 
                        and access to information about the property and the landlord as well as information and the remaining duration of their 
                        lease.</p>
                    <p>The final section of the platform would be the manager’s dashboard. As part of the manager dashboard, the user would be 
                        given access to tools that would allow them to book inspections of their property to ensure the tenant is keeping it clean 
                        and tidy, manage applications for new renters, manage the current tenant, get in contact with current and future tenants 
                        of the property and more. The manage dashboard would also allow the user to manage multiple properties as well as manage 
                        the information that is on the website about their properties. This information would include images of the property, description, 
                        weekly or monthly rent as well as giving the user an option to mark their property as ready to be rented out or not.</p>

                    <h3>Tools, Technolofy & Skills</h3>
                    <p>Ideally this platform would be designed and developed using a Software as a Service model, meaning that the website would 
                        designed and developed as a web based. To have this completed successfully, the development team would require a basic 
                        knowledge of the MERN technology stack or some equivalent.</p>
                    <p>The MERN technology stack is a JavaScript stack cantered around using MongoDB, the ExpressJS framework, React JS and Node.js 
                        as its core libraries. To ensure this style of software can run smoothly, the platform would have to hosted on a dedicated 
                        server, a Virtual Private Server or some equivalent of a cloud hosting that supports NodeJS applications.</p>
                    <p>All other libraries and frameworks that would be required for such a platform, including; session management, cookies, 
                        payment processing are already open source.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Overall Outcome</h3>
                    <p>If this project were to be successful, it would not only disrupt the rental market in Australia, it could also be expanded upon 
                        to become an international platform and help disrupt the property rental market in other countries. Not only this, but if 
                        this platform were successful it would give property owners access to a passive income from their properties or spare rooms 
                        at home.</p>
